# Intrusion-Detection-in-Networks-Using-Machine-Learning-
This project focuses on building an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can detect suspicious network activity using machine learning algorithms. The system analyzes network traffic data and classifies it as either normal or malicious to enhance cybersecurity and prevent attacks.
